            %p Alive is a tool I developed for myself to track my everyday efficency.
            %h2 So how to use it?

            %ul.bulleted
              %li Click on a pencil icon to create or edit desired diary entries;
              %li A diary entry can be a text area, a check box, or a short text input;
              %li You can also rearrange them as you wish;
              %li Then click on a calendar icon â€” you'll see a today diary page;
              %li A list icon will bring you to, well, a list of your days. Yep, it's that simple!
              %li If you don't want to see the entry in your diary but might need it later, feel free to hide it. You can do it on the edit diary page.

            %p Feel free to just click the icons and get yourself comfortable with the app. It's friendly and made with love <3
